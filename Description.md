Bocce Ball Scoreboard is an all-in-one app that keeps score during a Bocce Ball game.  The Scoreboard displays the points earned by each team each round.  The 45-minute timer tells you how much time is left in the game.  Game history can be seen on the Stats page.  There's even a LineUp page so you know whose turn it is to roll!

Scoreboard Page:
• Customize Team Names
• Save the score of each round
• Edit previous rounds
• See how much time is left in the game
• Game Over sound when a team wins, or when time runs out

LineUp Page:
• Customize player names
• Keep track of whose turn it is to roll
• Reorder players, or just scramble them

Stats Page:
• See previous games that have been played

Coming Soon:
• Color redesign.  I know it's really ugly (that's most of the feedback anyway), so please enjoy the ugliness while you can.  It'll be gone someday.  You'll miss it.
• Customizable timer (30-minute, 45-minute, 60-minute, or no-timer)
• Ability to share Game Stats (email and Facebook, probably)

Coming Later:
• Optional Player Stats: After scoring a round, you can specify how many points each player scored.  These stats will be stored for Player Statistics.
• Throw-by-throw mode: After each throw, Player and Throw Grade (Great Shot, Good Shot, or Meh Shot) can be input.  Throw Grades are recorded and used to calculate MVP (+2 for Great Shot, +1 for Good Shot, -1 for Meh Shot).  This will involve more work by the user (probably not for the casual player), but is something that's been requested, as it is already implemented in many competitive leagues on paper.
